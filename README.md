# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Helloow! I'm **Afyra** 👋  
This repository is where I keep my Python learning exercises, from beginner to more advanced stuff.

## 📚 What’s Inside
- Basic Python exercises (if/else, loops, functions, arguments)
- Small projects like BMI calculator, temperature converter, inventory system
- Experiments and random practice codes 

## 🎯 Goals
- Get better at problem-solving with Python  
- Learn about automation, AI, and maybe some web stuff later  
- Build cool projects and grow this repo over time!
